# Audio Course (Hugging Face)

## Course description

Dear learner,

Welcome to this course on using transformers for audio. Time and again transformers have proven themselves as one of the most powerful and versatile deep learning architectures, capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and more recently, audio processing.

In this course, we will explore how transformers can be applied to audio data. Youâ€™ll learn how to use them to tackle a range of audio-related tasks. Whether you are interested in speech recognition, audio classification, or generating speech from text, transformers and this course have got you covered.

Throughout the course, you will gain an understanding of the specifics of working with audio data, youâ€™ll learn about different transformer architectures, and youâ€™ll train your own audio transformers leveraging powerful pre-trained models.

This course is designed for learners with a background in deep learning, and general familiarity with transformers. No expertise in audio data processing is required. If you need to brush up on your understanding of transformers, check out our [NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1?fw=pt) that goes into much detail on the transformer basics.

## Course structure

The course is structured into several units that covers various topics in depth:
* **Unit 1**: learn about the specifics of working with audio data, including audio processing techniques and data preparation.
* **Unit 2**: get to know audio applications and learn how to use ðŸ¤— Transformers pipelines for different tasks, such as audio classification and speech recognition.
* **Unit 3**: explore audio transformer architectures, learn how they differ, and what tasks they are best suited for.
* **Unit 4**: learn how to build your own music genre classifier.
* **Unit 5**: delve into speech recognition and build a model to transcribe meeting recordings.
* **Unit 6**: learn how to generate speech from text.
* **Unit 7**: learn how to build real-world audio applications with transformers.

Each unit includes a theoretical component, where you will gain a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and techniques. Throughout the course, we provide quizzes to help you test your knowledge and reinforce your learning. Some chapters also include hands-on exercises, where you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learned.

By the end of the course, you will have a strong foundation in using transformers for audio data and will be well-equipped to apply these techniques to a wide range of audio-related tasks.
